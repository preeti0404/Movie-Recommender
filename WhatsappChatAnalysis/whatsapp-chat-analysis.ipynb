      "So as we mentioned in yesterday's meeting. There is some work for you guys already. Some of you have already been informed, but you guys have to come up with a proposal for an event to be conducted during Tech Tatva by IEEE SBM. Since we won't be the active board during October, we decided you guys should propose and work on an event that's your brainchild and something you guys are passionate about. The deadline for the event proposal is *15/7/22*. Start discussion amongst yourselves ASAP. I'll be forwarding the relevant details that I have from the meeting with SC. If you all have any questions, feel free to ask after going through everything. React to this message with a ❤️ after you guys have gone through the minutes of the meeting and brochure once.\n",

      "12/07/22, 3:07 pm - Anurag C Ieeesbm: That's hard to implement actually. We did discuss something like someone giving them the location if they pass all the test cases. I think we'll have to go through it like that.\n",
      "12/07/22, 3:08 pm - Anurag C Ieeesbm: We'll have to change the judge environment to hide location on the test cases ig. That'll be a little painful\n",

Some of you have already been informed, but you guys have to come up with a proposal for an event to be conducted during Tech Tatva by IEEE SBM. Since we won't be the active board during October, we decided you guys should propose and work on an event that's your brainchild and something you guys are passionate about. The deadline for the event proposal is *15/7/22*. Start discussion amongst yourselves ASAP. I'll be forwarding the relevant details that I have from the meeting with SC. If you all have any questions, feel free to ask after going through everything.

The format of the document will be put up on the group.\\n\\n• Deadline for submitting the proposal is *15th July 2022*\\n\\n• The Clubs can refer to the previous categories and events under TechTatva to get a better idea. \\n\\n• Clubs can either choose to follow the same category and events or they're also open to new category/event ideas.\\n\\n*Two or more clubs can collaborate to form a category in TechTatva.
